# BrowserStack App Automate - Espresso

Run Espresso tests on BrowserStack

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

Run your Espresso tests on BrowserStack App Automate. This step collects the built APK from `$BITRISE_APK_PATH` and test apk from `$BITRISE_TEST_APK_PATH` environment variables.

## Configure the Step

Before configuring this step, make sure you install [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise) in your machine.

Complete the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-bitrise-espresso-step.git
  ```
2. Open the cloned repository and create a `.bitrise.secrets.yml` file at the same level of bitrise.yml to add your BrowserStack Username and Access Key.
  An example `.bitrise.secrets.yml` file is as follows:
  ```yml
    envs:
      - A_SECRET_PARAM_ONE: the value for secret one
      - A_SECRET_PARAM_TWO: the value for secret two
  ```
3. Go to the cloned repository and start the workflow editor:
  ```bash
  cd browserstack-bitrise-espresso-step
  bitrise :workflow-editor
  ```
4. Visit the workflow editor that starts on `http://localhost:50154/1.3.87/#!/workflows` by default.
5. On the workflow editor page, from the `WORKFLOW` drop-down, select `test`.
6. From the left navigation menu, click `Step Test`.
7. Provide values to the keys listed in the `Input variables` section. Check out the [configuration](#‚öôÔ∏è-configuration) section to learn about each key.
8. Save the configuration. You can now see the configuration in the `bitrise.yml` file created in the cloned repository.
9. Run the test using the following command:
  ```bash
  bitrise run test
  ```


## Troubleshooting

If you get the **Build already exists** error, it is because you have more than one instance of the Step in your Workflow. This doesn't work as Bitrise sends the build slug to Firebase and having the Step more than once in the same Workflow results in sending the same build slug multiple times.

## üß© Get started

Add this step directly to your workflow in the [Bitrise Workflow Editor](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/steps-and-workflows/steps-and-workflows-index/).

You can also run this step directly with [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise).
